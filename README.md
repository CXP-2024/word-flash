This is a simple word reviewer.

Remember to put your word list into `word_list.txt` with the following format:
```

definition1
word2
definition2
...
```

There is a `Go.bat` file included. Adjust it to point to your Python interpreter.
Then you can just double click it to start the python file on your Windows

Press 'L' to show the explanation, and 'Enter' to show the next word
